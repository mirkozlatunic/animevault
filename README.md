## What is AnimeVault?

AnimeVault is a single-page web app built for anime fans who want to explore the greatest series ever made and discover the quotes that defined them. Every entry is ranked, rated, tagged by genre, and loaded with real iconic lines from the show.

No accounts. No backend. No clutter. Just anime and words worth remembering.

## What I Learned

- Component-driven UI architecture with reusable cards, modals, and filter controls
- Clipboard API and Web Share API integration for cross-platform copy/share functionality
- Responsive masonry grid layouts with CSS and Tailwind for varying content heights
- Client-side persistence with localStorage for user voting state
- CSS animation choreography — staggered card entrances, modal scale-ins, and filter transitions

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add character profile pages with voice actor info and episode appearances
- [ ] Anime recommendation engine based on genre preferences
- [ ] Persistent community leaderboard with a backend (currently votes are local-only)
